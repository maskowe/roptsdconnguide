    <b>Searching Channels:</b>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    It's important to remember that you are always searching for channels/messages by choosing either:
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    <ul>
      <li>Only other members (channels that are not in your channels list)</li>
      <li>Only my own channels (channels that ARE in your channels list - including the global channel)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    To search for channels, you:
  </p>

  <hr>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    <ul>
      <li>Need to find a channel from a list of of all types and names that are not in your channel list</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Search all channels by name with Only other members by choosing "All channels by name", and leaving
      the name blank. This will return all channels that are NOT your channels.   
      Pressing these channels will not open the channel. You can join service channels if you want by 
      pressing the service channel avatar, you can join that channel and send a message.  Then later,
      you can leave the channel if you want.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Leaving blank for all all will return all channels in name order.
