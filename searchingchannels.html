    <b>Searching Channels:</b>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    It's important to remember that you are always searching for channels/messages by choosing either:
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    <ul>
      <li>Only other members (channels that are not in your channels list)</li>
      <li>Only my own channels (channels that ARE in your channels list - including the global channel)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    To search for channels, you:
  </p>

  <hr>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    <ul>
      <li>Need to find a channel from a list of of all types and names that are not in your channel list</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Search all channels by name with Only other members by choosing "All channels by name", and leaving
      the name blank. This will return all channels that are NOT your channels.   
      Pressing these channels will not open the channel. You can join service channels if you want by 
      pressing the service channel avatar, you can join that channel and send a message.  Then later,
      you can leave the channel if you want.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Leaving blank for all all will return all channels in name order.

    <ul>
      <li>Need to find channel(s) with the message content of (some text) that are not in your channel list</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    search for messages containing specific content on the channels search. Then if found, press on that message, 
      it will open that channel with that message with any other messages ordered by relevance in a list.   
      If you want to send a message to that channel, leave search (go back arrow). 
      if it's a service channel you're not a member of, just do a channel search
      on it by name, then press the avatar and join it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Note that any messages on that channel could be from users that USED TO BE on that channel,
      but have since left the channel.

      <li>Non-residence location (if I've set one)</li>
      <li>My current physical location</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Channels closest to your choice are returned, limited to three locations.
	    These channels don't always appear in closer to farther order.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Note that this search option isn't available if you choose "Only my own channels".
      Also note that the current physical location can take a minute longer, since your
      device has to determine exactly where you area first.

      and leaving the name blank. This will return all location channels that are NOT your channels.
