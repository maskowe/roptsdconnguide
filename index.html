  <h1>RolloutPTSD Connect Guide</h1>
  <p>
    Registering:
  </p>
  <p>
    After registering, the list will at minimum be two channels:  the global "RolloutPTSD" 
	    channel that everyone is a member of and at least one location channel.  If you
	    identified yourself as a particular service type, you will have those channels also.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you change your profile service type, it will change your membership to those
      channels (leave the current if they're different) and add you as a member to new
      service channel types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changing your location(s) will also change your channels and memberships from 
	    current to new channels for those locations.
