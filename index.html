    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      After registering, your channel list will at minimum be two channels:  the global "RolloutPTSD" 
        channel that everyone is a member of and at least one location channel.  If you
        identified yourself as a particular service type, you will have those channels also.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      If you change your profile service type, it will change your membership to those
        channels (will leave the current if they're the same) and add you as a member to new
        service channel types.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      Changing your location(s) will also change your channels and memberships from 
        current to new channels for those locations.
    </p>

      <ul style="margin-left: 20">
        <li>Global "RolloutPTSD" channel</li>
        <li>Service channels</li>
        <li>Location channels</li>
        <li>One-on-One channels</li>

    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      All users are joined in the global channel when registering.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      Any user can join a one-on-one channel with another user by
	      ressing that user item shown on the "Users" tab at bottom
        and sending a message to them.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      Any user can join a service channel by joining with the button on the channel avatar pop-up from Search Results.
        It can be temporary (you can leave if and when you want).  
	      You can also join a service channel by editing your profile and changing your service type there.
