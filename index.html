    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      After registering, the list will at minimum be two channels:  the global "RolloutPTSD" 
        channel that everyone is a member of and at least one location channel.  If you
        identified yourself as a particular service type, you will have those channels also.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      If you change your profile service type, it will change your membership to those
        channels (will leave the current if they're the same) and add you as a member to new
        service channel types.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
      Changing your location(s) will also change your channels and memberships from 
        current to new channels for those locations.
