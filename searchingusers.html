    Search by choosing "All users by name", and leaving the name blank. This will return all users in name order.
	    Name entered can be partial or full (FirstName<space>LastName). and will

    Choose an option with "User by air distance". Note that the current physical location can take a minute longer, 
      since your device has to determine exactly where you area first.

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    Search "All Users near location name" and enter a location that is specific
      enough to pass a review based on geocoding.  In other words, if you don't
      get an expected result based on your entered location, maybe you need to 
      add the state or region to that location.
      The system doesn't check for review status, as it does when entered on your
      profile.
